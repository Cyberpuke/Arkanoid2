Arkanoid 2 uses a 256 directional ball movement engine and this 
makes directing it with the paddle interesting. If you hit the ball
on the very edge of the paddle it will change the direction of the 
ball accordingly. 

Keys:
F1 - Save game and Exit. This is useful if you make a level set 
that has a lot of levels.
Left & right - move the paddle
Exit - Exit game
More - Pause game
Enter - during menus will select.


Bonus:
101 -  this will add to your score 501 points

External Levels:
To install external levels, just send the .86s file to your calc
along with the program. The level editor has its own documentation
included in its zip, the editor was written by Corey <ACZ>.

TitleScreen:
The title screen is the string named Ark2Scrn. If you want, you 
can make your own external string file, just RLE encode a 4
level grayscale picture and name it Ark2Scrn. 

Versions:
